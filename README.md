DisWeek
=
A solo project started at Launch Academy, April 2016.
DisWeek is a Ruby on Rails web app that focuses on finding places that are trending.

App Limitations
=
Because of Instagram's strict API policies, access to their photo database is limited to the apps that they have reviewed and approved. Currently, the app is running on a sandbox environment. Only Instagram accounts that are associated with DisWeek's sandbox environment are authorized to log in. Likewise, the photos that are being queried are photos from users in DisWeek's sand box environment.

Key Features
=
* Using Devise and OmniAuth with Instagram, users can log in with their Instagram accounts
* Users can enter their current location or an address to query Bing Maps and Instagram APIs
* Users are able to see location information and more photos from that location
* After logging in, users can add photos to their album

Future Features
=
* Integrate animation button for adding picture to album
* Integrate JavaScript for adding pictures to album
* More accurate geolocation service
* Speeding up search query
* Better unit and feature test coverage
